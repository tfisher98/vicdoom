# Memory configuration for the C=128

# LD65 2.13.3 special segment documentation 
# * INIT -- init code that can be overwritten once execution reaches main()
# * LOWCODE -- guaranteed not to be banked out 
# * STARTUP -- startup code initializes the C software stack and libraries
# * ZPSAVE -- saves original values of zeropage locations used in ZEROPAGE segment
#
# LD65 git special segment documentation
# * INIT -- kind of non-zero-initialized 'bss' segment used by constructors in startup
# * LOWCODE -- guaranteed not to be banked out
# * ONCE -- used for init code run only once before execution reahces main()
# * STARTUP -- startup code initializes the C software stack and libraries
# * ZPSAVE -- saves original values of zeropage locations used in ZEROPAGE segment
#
# so the new ONCE is the old INIT; there is also a differently defined new INIT segment
